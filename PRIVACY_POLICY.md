# KeepJoy Privacy Policy
Last updated: March 28, 2024

KeepJoy ("we," "our," or "us") helps people declutter with intention. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect through the KeepJoy mobile and web experiences (collectively, the "Services"), how we use and share it, and the choices you have. By using the Services, you agree to this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

## Information We Collect
- **Account data**: Name, email address, preferred language, profile photo, and authentication tokens required to create or sign in to your account.
- **Content you add**: Memories, declutter plans, activity logs, attachments, survey responses, and other data you choose to upload or generate through KeepJoy.
- **Device and usage data**: Device model, OS version, app version, time zone, crash reports, and in-app actions that help us keep the Services reliable.
- **Location data**: Approximate region derived from IP address and any location you manually enter to tag items or sessions.
- **Support interactions**: Messages, emails, and metadata that you send to support@keepjoy.app or through in-app feedback tools.

## How We Use Information
- Provide, troubleshoot, and improve the Services.
- Personalize dashboards, insights, reminders, and recommendations.
- Communicate with you about updates, support, promotions, and policy changes.
- Monitor usage trends, detect fraud or abuse, and enforce our Terms of Service.
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from authorities.

## When We Share Information
We only share personal data in the circumstances below:
- With service providers that help us host data, process analytics, send notifications, or provide customer support. They access data solely to perform services for us and under confidentiality obligations.
- With integration partners or features that you explicitly enable (for example, exporting to an external marketplace). We will always let you confirm before any data leaves KeepJoy.
- With authorities when required by law, court order, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of KeepJoy, our users, or the public.
- During a corporate transaction such as a merger, financing, or sale of assets. We will notify you if your personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We do not sell your personal data.

## Data Retention
We retain personal data while your account is active and as needed to provide the Services. When you delete content or your account, we attempt to remove it from active systems within 30 days, though backups may persist for longer as required for business continuity, legal, or regulatory reasons.

## Your Choices and Rights
- **Access and correction**: View and update most data in-app. Contact support@keepjoy.app for anything you cannot edit yourself.
- **Export**: Use the profile export feature to obtain a copy of your KeepJoy data in a portable format.
- **Deletion**: Delete individual memories, sessions, or your entire account from the profile screen. We will remove associated personal data unless law requires us to keep it.
- **Notifications**: Manage push and email preferences inside the app or unsubscribe links in any message.

Depending on your location, you may have additional privacy rights (e.g., GDPR or CCPA). Contact us if you want to exercise any of these rights and we will respond within the applicable timeframe.

## Security
We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including encryption in transit, access controls, and regular security reviews. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, so we encourage you to use strong passwords and keep your devices up to date.

## International Data Transfers
We may process and store data in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate. By using the Services, you consent to transferring information to those jurisdictions, which may have data-protection laws different from your region.

## Children's Privacy
KeepJoy is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that we have, we will delete it and may disable the account.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will notify you via in-app notice, email, or other reasonable means before the new policy takes effect. Continued use after the effective date signifies your acceptance.
