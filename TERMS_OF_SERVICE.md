## 2. License and Acceptable Use
- We grant you a personal, revocable, non-transferable license to use KeepJoy solely for personal organization and decluttering purposes.
- You agree not to reverse engineer, attempt to gain unauthorized access, scrape, or use automated means to interact with the Services.

- Fees are non-refundable except where required by applicable law. We may change prices with prior notice. Continued use after a price change constitutes acceptance.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The Services may integrate with third-party tools (e.g., cloud storage, marketplaces). Your use of those integrations is subject to the third party's terms and privacy policies. KeepJoy is not responsible for third-party content or services.

We may offer preview features labeled "beta" or similar. They may be unstable or change at any time. By submitting feedback, you grant us the right to use it without restriction or compensation.

## 7. Termination
You may stop using KeepJoy at any time and delete your account from the profile page. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or use the Services in a way that risks harm to KeepJoy or other users. Upon termination, sections that by nature should survive (including ownership, disclaimers, liability, and dispute provisions) remain in effect.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KEEPJOY AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

## 10. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold KeepJoy harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 11. Changes to the Services and Terms
We may update the Services or these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (for example, via email or in-app). Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## 12. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to their jurisdiction.
